# This combines the rolling upgrade playbooks to perform an upgrade of an entire MooseFS cluster, as safely as automatically possible.
# On MooseFS CE, the only service interruption should occur during the master upgrade, everything else is designed to happen without downtime.
# It currently does not yet upgrade the master, nor clients, but support for that is planned.
# It will upgrade metaloggers first, then masters, then chunkservers, then clients, but will not restart mounts automatically.
