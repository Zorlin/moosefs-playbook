moosefs-playbook
================

MooseFS on autopilot. Makes setting up, upgrading, maintaining and troubleshooting MooseFS a breeze.

Doesn't yet support all features, but those needed for my personal MooseFS installation will be added as needed, and those I think are super cool probably even before them.

Full instructions coming soon.

Early WIP...

inventory = testing purposes

inventory-production is an example of what I use in my homelab/Elastic NAS

TODO
====

* rolling: Look into free_strategy

* rolling: Look into serial: "90%"
